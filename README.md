# HMRC/Capgemini

The following are a list of changes I would have liked to make, given more time:

* Better organisation of css, including better naming conventions that encourage code-reuse
* Use of high quality assets - suitable for screens/devices with high pixel density
* Look into adopting a CSS methodology, namely BEM or SMACSS
* Accurate colour sampling
* Attention to detail with regards to layout measurement and asset sizing
